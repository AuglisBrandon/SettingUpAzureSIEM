# SettingUpAzureSIEM
I will be giving a tutorial of how to set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine that will have an active honey pot. The goal is to observe live RDP Brute Force attacks from all over. We will also use PowerShell to look up attackers geolocation info and plot it in Azure Sentinel Map.
